# PB-metagenomics-tools

Welcome! Here you can find a variety of tools and pipelines tailored to using PacBio HiFi reads for metagenomics.

There are currently three pipelines available:

+ **Genome-Binning-Pipeline**: Perform genome binning and MAG assessment on HiFi assemblies using a streamlined workflow.

+ **Taxonomic-Functional-Profiling-Protein**: Align HiFi reads to a **protein** database and prepare inputs for MEGAN6, for the purpose of taxonomic and functional profiling.

+ **Taxonomic-Functional-Profiling-Nucelotide**: Align HiFi reads to a **nucleotide** database and prepare inputs for MEGAN6, for the purpose of taxonomic and functional profiling.


These pipelines can be found in their respective folders. They are available as Snakemake workflows.

Documentation is currently being written. We intend to have all pipelines fully documented by the end of September 2020. Advanced users can look in the snake files for a complete picture of the workflow, including the commands used to call all respective programs. For others, we encourage you to please check back soon!
