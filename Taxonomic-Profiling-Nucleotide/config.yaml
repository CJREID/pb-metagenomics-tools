minimap:
  # Provide the full path to the minimap2-indexed database.
  # We recommend downloading the NCBI nt database from: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/nt.gz*
  # Please note the gzipped nt database as of July 2020 was 82GB in size.
  # The database should be indexed using: minimap2 -k 19 -w 10 -d mm2_nt_db.mmi nt.gz
  # The k and w settings are specific to this pipeline.
  # This indexing can take several hours, and will result in a file that is ~860GB in size.

  # The number of threads to use for minimap2 alignments.
  threads: 24
  
  # The number of secondary alignments to allow; 20 is reasonable for the LCA algorithm 
  # in MEGAN. Increasing this number will cause the SAM file to become much larger in size, 
  # sometimes over 500 GB. 
  secondary: 20
  
  # directory location to write large temporary files during SAM sort stage
  # default is "/scratch", but if that is unavailable specify another directory location
