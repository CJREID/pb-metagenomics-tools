diamond:
  # Provide the full path to the diamond-indexed database.
  # We recommend downloading the NCBI nr database from: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/nr.gz*
  # Please note the gzipped nr database as of July 2020 was 82GB in size.
  # The database can be indexed using: diamond makedb --in nr.gz --db diamond_nr_db --threads 24
  # This can take several hours, and will result in a file that is ~150GB in size.
  db: "/pbi/dept/appslab/datasets/dp_databases/diamond_nr_db.dmnd"
  
  # The block_size sets how many billions of letters are loaded in from the database at once.
  # Larger numbers are better, but the memory required is roughly 6x the block size.
  # If you keep the value below of 12, this will require 96GB of memory to run.
  block_size: "12"
